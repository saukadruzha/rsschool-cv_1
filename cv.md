## Briefly about myself
I'm a Computer Science student (BSc) in BSU FAMCS focused on Applied Mathematics, Computer Science and Management. But as a communicable and managerial student I'm really interested in Project Management in the sphere of Web-development.
During the last year I've been working in student solidarity initiative as a recorder of data, maintained the functionality of the site and resources, where I've received a great experience of team management and some of basic methods in Front-End Development.
So, as a 1st-year student I am ready to learn and self-develop in this direction further to become not only a proficient Frontend Developer but a proficient communicator and manager.

## Code Example
***Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:***
In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.
The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.
```
#include <cmath>
bool is_square(int n)
{
std::cin>>n;
int c =sqrt(n);
if(n == pow(c, 2))
  return true;
else
  return false;
}
```
